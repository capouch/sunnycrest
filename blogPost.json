title: Barn
---

It isn't known precisely when the barn was constructed, but it appears to be a bit newer than the main house.  It still retains almost all of its original features, including an elaborate metal ventilator on top, which has faux shingles on its base.

The interior features a number of pens and gates between them, and a hay mow with sliding doors that allow hay to be thrown into a manger below.  It has two grain bins, and a milking stanchion.
